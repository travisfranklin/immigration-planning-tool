**Size**: 744 lines  
**Sections**: 7 major sections  
**Examples**: 3 detailed real-world examples with calculations

**Table of Contents**:
1. Overview
2. Two-Stage Scoring System
3. Overall Score Calculation

- `SCORING_FIXES_COMPLETE.md` - Bug fix details

**Problems**:
- No single source of truth
- Hard to understand complete picture
- Required reading code to understand scoring
- No user-facing documentation
- No examples with calculations
