# Shareable Results Feature - Documentation Index

## üìã Overview

This feature enables users to share their immigration viability assessment results with others via URL links. When User A shares a link like `https://app.example.com/result-detail/AT?results=<encoded_data>`, User B can view the complete results without needing to create a profile or calculate scores.

## üìä Key Decisions

### ‚úÖ Approved Approach: URL Parameters with Compression

**Why?**
- ‚úÖ No backend required (zero infrastructure cost)
- ‚úÖ Fast implementation (2-3 hours)
- ‚úÖ Works immediately
- ‚úÖ No privacy concerns (no PII in data)
- ‚úÖ Sufficient URL length (~800 chars vs 2000+ limit)

**Trade-offs Accepted**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No analytics tracking (can add later)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No link expiration (can add with backend later)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Data visible in URL (acceptable - no sensitive data)

## üîß Technical Stack

### Dependencies
- **lz-string** (v1.5.0): Compression library
  - Size: ~9KB minified
  - Compression ratio: ~75% reduction
  - Browser support: All modern browsers

### Files to Create
1. `src/utils/shareableResults.ts` - Core utilities
2. `src/utils/shareableResults.test.ts` - Unit tests
3. `src/components/results/ShareResultButton.tsx` - Share button component (optional)

### Files to Modify
1. `src/pages/ResultDetail.tsx` - Add shared view support
2. `src/pages/ResultDetail.test.tsx` - Add shared view tests

## üîí Security & Privacy

### Data in URLs
**What's shared**: ViabilityScore object containing:
- Country codes and names
- Numerical scores (0-100)
- Program IDs and names
- Risk factors and contingencies
- Recommended programs

**What's NOT shared**:
- ‚ùå User names
- ‚ùå Email addresses
- ‚ùå Phone numbers
- ‚ùå Addresses
- ‚ùå Passport numbers
- ‚ùå Any personally identifiable information (PII)

### Security Measures
- ‚úÖ HTTPS required in production
- ‚úÖ Data is compressed (not encrypted - not needed)
- ‚úÖ No server-side storage
- ‚úÖ No authentication required to view shared results
- ‚úÖ Read-only view (no editing allowed)

**Risk Assessment**: üü¢ Low - No sensitive data exposed

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Share button doesn't copy URL
- **Cause**: Browser clipboard permissions
- **Solution**: Ensure HTTPS, check browser console for errors

**Issue**: Shared URL shows error
- **Cause**: URL was truncated or modified
- **Solution**: Generate new share link

**Issue**: URL too long
- **Cause**: Excessive data in ViabilityScore
- **Solution**: Review data structure, verify compression is working

**Issue**: Shared view not loading
- **Cause**: URL parameter not detected
- **Solution**: Check useSearchParams implementation
