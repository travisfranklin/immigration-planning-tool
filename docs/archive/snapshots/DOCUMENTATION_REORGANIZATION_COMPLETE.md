## Documentation Standards Established

### For Current Documentation
1. Keep in `/docs` root or appropriate subdirectory
2. Update regularly to reflect current project state
3. Maintain accurate links and cross-references
4. Follow markdown best practices

### For Historical Documentation
1. Move to `/docs/archive/` when work is complete
2. Organize by category
3. Do NOT update (preserve as historical record)
4. Reference from current docs if needed

### For New Documentation

2. Place in appropriate location
3. Update INDEX.md if adding core documentation
4. Follow established naming conventions
