## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Local-First Design
```
User Input → React Components → IndexedDB → Calculations → Display
(No Server | No Cloud | No Network Requests)
```

### Three-Tier Architecture
- **UI Layer**: React components for forms, dashboard, flowcharts
- **Business Logic**: Viability calculator, risk analyzer, contingency planner
- **Storage Layer**: IndexedDB for local data persistence

### Data Privacy
✅ All data stored locally (IndexedDB)  
✅ No server-side persistence  
✅ No network transmission of user data  
✅ No tracking or analytics  
✅ User can export/delete all data

## 📊 Viability Algorithm

**Weighted Scoring Formula**:
```
Overall Score = (
  Career × 0.30 +
  Financial × 0.25 +
  Education × 0.20 +
  Language × 0.15 +
  Family × 0.10
)
```

**Score Interpretation**:
- 80-100: Excellent viability ✅
- 60-79: Good viability ✅
- 40-59: Moderate viability ⚠️
- 20-39: Low viability ⚠️
- 0-19: Very low viability ❌
