description: "A list of rules to follow on every task"
---

Before you begin a task check to see if:
1. any uncommitted code exists in the repository and commit it (using conventional commits).
2. any tests are failing. If they are, fix them before you begin the task.
3. any eslint errors exist and fix them.
4. any build errors exist and fix them.
Commit any of this code before you begin your task (using conventional commits).

When working on your task:
1. Avoid magic strings to reduce errors and keep your code DRY.
2. Write tests for your work if none exist already (following test-driven development best practices).
3. If building UI, maintain German design principles (like those of Braun and Dieter Rams and the Ulm School of Design), which emphasize minimalism and functionality, and Scandinavian design with its clean lines and bold colors

Before you complete your task check to see if:
1. any uncommitted code exists in the repository and commit it (using conventional commits).
2. any tests are failing and fix them.
3. any eslint errors exist and fix them.
4. any build errors exist and fix them.
